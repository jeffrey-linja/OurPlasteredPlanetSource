From Godwin:
"If you can't get the view to update itself automatically, you can get it to update after the user stops interacting/moving the mouse or even an update button. Also, take a look at this (https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003nk)."

Fun fact: you can drag and create a region on each axis to highlight certain lines. Double click on the axis outside of the region to clear the selection.
